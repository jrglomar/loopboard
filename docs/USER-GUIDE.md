# Loopboard — User Guide

**Loopboard** is an Agile team dashboard and AI assistant that sits on top of your Jira (and,
optionally, GitHub). It turns your sprint into a live board, a daily-huddle digest, planning and
reporting tools, leave/capacity tracking, and an AI helper that drafts tickets and answers
questions.

This guide has two parts:
- **[What Loopboard offers](#what-loopboard-offers)** — a tour of every feature.
- **[Setting up Loopboard](#setting-up-loopboard)** — how to connect it to your Jira and run it.

> Deeper docs: developer setup in [`docs/SETUP.md`](SETUP.md), deployment in
> [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md), the AI assistant in [`docs/ASSISTANT.md`](ASSISTANT.md),
> and the full API/behavior contract in [`docs/CONTRACTS.md`](CONTRACTS.md).

## What Loopboard offers

Loopboard is organized into tabs across the top. Your team works against two Jira boards — a **PO
board** (product / stories) and a **Dev board** (development tasks) — and a board switcher in the
top‑right lets you flip between them on most pages.

### 🟦 Huddle — the daily dashboard

Your run‑the‑standup home screen.

- **Sprint board** — the selected sprint's issues in **To Do · In Progress · Code Review · Done**
  columns, with points, assignees, and a "has‑PR" badge on linked tickets. Filter by assignee.
- **Daily Huddle digest** — a copy‑pastable summary of the sprint, viewable **by status** or **by
  person** (walk‑the‑board‑by‑person standups).
- **Sidebar widgets** (each collapsible — click the chevron in a card's header; your choices are
  remembered):
  - **Meeting goal** — today's standup focus (distinct from the Jira sprint goal).
  - **Meeting notes** — a rich‑text (WYSIWYG) notepad for deployment notes, runbook links, reminders.
  - **Impediments** — a per‑sprint blocker log.
  - **On leave** — who's out today and in the next 7 days.
  - **Code review** — pull requests linked to the sprint's tickets (multi‑repo), with approval status.
- **Fly‑in tracker** — a strip highlighting "fly‑in" tickets across the Dev and PO boards.
- **Auto‑refresh** every few minutes, with a "last updated" stamp.
- **Ticket aging** — the sprint board's **In Progress** tickets each carry an age chip, and the
  sidebar's **Ticket aging** card lists them worst‑first (code‑review tickets are *not* aged —
  code review counts as done, per your Definition of Done). Age is the time since the ticket
  entered the column (from the Jira changelog), and it never starts before the sprint does — a
  ticket carried over mid‑flight starts its clock at the sprint's start date. The expected time is
  `base days + days‑per‑point × story points` (unpointed tickets use base days alone) — both
  admin‑configurable. A ticket reads **ok** under 100% of that expectation, **watch** from
  100–150%, and **overdue** past 150%. Tickets with no changelog history show no age at all,
  rather than a guess.

### 🗓️ Planning — grooming & sprint prep

Everything you need to prepare the next sprint.

- **Create a sprint** and target new tickets into it.
- **Ticket generator** — draft PO stories and Dev tasks (AI‑assisted when AI is enabled; deterministic
  templates otherwise), created straight into the chosen board's sprint.
- **Leaves / team calendar** — plot each teammate's leave by type (Vacation / Emergency / Holiday /
  Offset); the plotter shows each developer's remaining capacity (required points − leave days).
- **Assignment list** — assign the sprint's tickets to developers (bulk‑assign supported), and edit
  story points inline.
- **Team roster** — curate the team members Loopboard plans around (drawn from recent sprint activity).

### 📅 Offset Tracker — leaves & offset wallet

- **Typed leaves** — Vacation, Emergency, Holiday, and **Offset** days per person.
- **Offset wallet** — earned offset banks automatically per sprint; spending auto‑deducts from Offset
  leaves. See each developer's balance and a full **history** of earns and spends.

### 🔗 Linking — turn PO stories into Dev tasks

- Select PO stories and **bulk‑create linked Dev tasks**, with an AI plan drafted from each story's
  description.
- **Point‑driven breakdown** — a story's points auto‑split into one or two Dev tasks on the allowed
  scale (e.g. 4 → 2 + 2), each with its own points and assignee.
- Links are created so the **PO story "depends on" its Dev task(s)**.

### 📊 Reports — sprint review & metrics

- **Per‑sprint report** — committed vs. completed points, completion rate, and a by‑assignee table.
  (Code‑review‑complete counts as done, per your Definition of Done.)
- **Velocity** — the average of recent closed sprints, capacity‑adjusted for leave.
- **Burndown chart** — actual vs. ideal points remaining across the sprint's working days.
- **Retrospective** — a persisted retro (reason for delays, what worked, what didn't, improvements,
  kudos) that also **pre‑fills the full‑report export**.
- **Export** — Copy (Markdown), a **printable PDF**, or a **styled Excel** workbook with a per‑member
  table (committed/completed points + leaves by type + offset balance).
- **AI executive summary** — an on‑demand narrative of the sprint (when AI is enabled).
- **Trends & KPIs** — a second mode (toggle next to the board switcher) that reports across a *window*
  of sprints instead of one: committed/completed points, rate, carryover and blocked counts per sprint,
  team‑wide averages, and a per‑developer view (pick a name to see their trend). The window defaults to
  a **date range** pre‑filled to the span of the last 10 closed sprints — or choose the **last N** closed
  sprints instead, or **pick sprints** individually — then export the same way (Copy, .md, .csv).
  Per‑developer KPIs are leave‑adjusted: each plotted leave day (Vacation, Emergency, Holiday, or Offset)
  reduces that developer's sprint target by a point, so their **met target** mark reflects the adjusted
  number, not the flat team target.

### 🔌 Accounts & Connections

Loopboard is **login‑gated and per‑user**: sign up, then open the **Connections** tab and connect
**your own** Jira and GitHub tokens (plus an AI token if you want the AI features) — the app
unlocks the moment Jira and GitHub are connected.

Your tokens are **encrypted at rest and never shown back to you** (only a masked "…last4" hint).
Admins can also onboard viewers on **shared credentials** (read‑only against Jira unless granted
writes). See [Enabling accounts (login)](#enabling-accounts-login) to turn accounts on.

### 🤖 AI assistant (floating widget)

The lower‑right chat button is available on every tab. When AI is enabled you can **ask questions**
about the current sprint ("what's in code review?", "who owns VRDB‑1234?", "any impediments today?")
and even **propose changes** (update points, move a ticket, set a sprint goal, file leave) — each
change is shown for **confirmation before it's applied**. Nothing is changed without your OK.

### 🧰 Using the MCP tools

Every tab above is a thin UI over **48 MCP tools**, split across two servers: `mcp-jira` (43
tools — tickets, sprints, reports, leaves, the offset wallet, the Huddle stores) and `mcp-github`
(5 tools — pull requests). There are two ways to reach them:

- **VS Code Copilot Chat** gets **all 48**. This repo's `.vscode/mcp.json` registers both servers,
  and VS Code loads them automatically the moment you open the workspace folder — see **Step 3**
  of [`docs/SETUP.md`](SETUP.md). Copilot talks to them over **stdio**; the dashboard instead
  talks to an HTTP bridge in front of the same tool registry (see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, §7, for
  the split). Three tools have **no dashboard button at all** and are Copilot‑only: `get_pr`
  (full detail on one pull request), `get_pr_reviews` (batch approval status), and
  `sync_pr_links` (auto‑link every open PR in a repo to its Jira ticket).
- **The floating AI assistant** (bottom‑right, every tab) reaches a curated subset: **19 read
  tools** it can call on its own to answer a question, and **7 write tools** it can only
  *propose* — every proposed change waits in a confirmation dialog until you approve it (see "AI
  assistant", above). It never calls a GitHub tool; anything it tells you about PRs comes from
  Jira's own linked‑issue data, not a live GitHub call.

**Jira/GitHub tools vs. local tools.** Most tools act on your real Jira boards (or, for the PR
tools, GitHub) — those changes land immediately. A second group instead reads and writes
Loopboard's own local store: the team roster, typed leaves, the offset ledger, and the Huddle
sidebar's impediments, post‑scrum notes, meeting goal, meeting notes, and retro. Those are
Loopboard app state rather than Jira history, so they work the same for everyone regardless of
Jira write permissions.

**Shared‑credential users:** an account that's borrowing someone else's Jira connection has its
Jira‑mutating tools **blocked with a read‑only error** unless an admin has explicitly granted it
write access. Local‑store tools (leaves, retro, notes, impediments…) always work for these
accounts too, since nothing there is attributed to a Jira user.

A few prompts that work well in Copilot Chat:

> "What's in code review on the Dev board right now?"
> "Create a PO story for CSV export on Reports, with a linked Dev task."
> "Check the review status of PRs 41, 42, and 44 in our repo."
> "Auto-link every open PR to its Jira ticket."
> "What's our velocity over the last three sprints?"

### 📋 Tool reference

All 48 tools, grouped the same way the in‑app Guide groups them. **Type** marks which system a
tool acts on and whether it reads or writes; **AI** marks whether the floating assistant can call
it itself (`Ask`), only propose it for your confirmation (`Propose`), or not reach it at all
(`—` — dashboard-only or Copilot‑only).

## Setting up Loopboard

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** (Node 22 recommended) and npm.
- A **Jira Cloud** account with permission to view your boards, plus an **API token**
  (create one at <https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens>).
- The IDs of your **PO board** and **Dev board** (the number in a board URL:
  `…/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=<ID>`).
- *(Optional)* An **AI provider** — an Anthropic API key, or a GitHub token with the **Models: read**
  permission — to enable the AI features. Without it, Loopboard falls back to deterministic templates.
- *(Optional)* A **GitHub** token if you want linked‑PR and repo features.

### 1. Configure your environment

Copy the template and fill it in (root `.env`, or `packages/mcp-jira/.env`):

```bash
cp packages/mcp-jira/.env.example packages/mcp-jira/.env
```

**Required — connect to Jira:**

```ini
JIRA_BASE_URL=https://yourcompany.atlassian.net
JIRA_EMAIL=you@company.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your-api-token
JIRA_PO_BOARD_ID=10001         # your PO board id
JIRA_DEV_BOARD_ID=10002        # your Dev board id
```

**Optional — tuning** (sensible defaults shown):

```ini
JIRA_STORY_POINTS_FIELD=customfield_10016
JIRA_LINK_TYPE=Depends on            # must match a link type in your Jira
JIRA_CODE_REVIEW_STATUSES=code review,in review,peer review,review
JIRA_VELOCITY_SPRINTS=6
```

**Optional — enable AI** (`anthropic` **or** `github`; leave `AI_PROVIDER` empty to disable):

```ini
AI_PROVIDER=anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# — or —
AI_PROVIDER=github
GITHUB_MODELS_TOKEN=github-token-with-models-read
```

> **AI not working?** If you see *"GitHub Models authentication failed … PAT needs models:read"*, your
> GitHub token is missing the **Models: read** permission — use a fine‑grained PAT that has it, or
> switch to `AI_PROVIDER=anthropic` with an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

### 2. Run it

Install once, then start the three processes (two MCP bridges + the web app):

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:all          # starts the Jira bridge (:4001), GitHub bridge (:4002) and web app (:5173)
```

Open **<http://localhost:5173>**. (You can also start each process separately —
`npm run dev:jira:http`, `npm run dev:github:http`, `npm run dev:app` — or deploy with Docker; see
[`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md).)

### 3. Verify

```bash
npm run typecheck && npm run test && npm run build   # all green, no network needed
node scripts/smoke.mjs                               # boots both bridges with stub creds
```

### Enabling accounts (login)

Per‑user accounts (the login gate + the Connections tab) are **off by default**. To turn them on,
add two secrets to the bridge's `.env` and restart it:

```bash
# generate the values:
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"   # → TOKEN_ENC_KEY
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('base64'))"   # → SESSION_SECRET
```

```ini
TOKEN_ENC_KEY=<32-byte base64 value>
SESSION_SECRET=<random base64 value>
```

Then each teammate **signs up** on the login screen and **connects their own** Jira and GitHub
tokens on the **Connections** tab. Tokens are AES‑256‑GCM encrypted at rest and are never returned
to the browser.

## Tips & FAQ

- **PO vs. Dev board:** use the board switcher (top‑right) to flip context. Linking works across both.
- **Collapsing clutter:** every Huddle sidebar card collapses via the chevron in its header — handy on
  long sprints. Your choices persist per browser.
- **"Bridge is offline":** a page can't reach the Jira/GitHub bridge — make sure `npm run dev:all` (or
  the individual `dev:*:http` processes) is running.
- **Sprint reports look empty:** confirm the board id is correct and the sprint has issues assigned to
  your rostered team members.
- **Security:** API tokens live only in the server's `.env` (team config) or the encrypted per‑user
  vault (Connections). They are never logged or sent to the browser.
