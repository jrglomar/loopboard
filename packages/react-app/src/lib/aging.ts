// aging.ts — ticket aging / Scrum Work Item Age (v1.58, ADR-070). Pure; no React, no network.
//
// "Work Item Age" = how long a ticket has been in flight. The expectation is SCALED BY STORY
// POINTS: a 1-pointer sitting for 5 days is a problem; a 13-pointer at 5 days may be fine.
//   expectedDays = baseDays + daysPerPoint × storyPoints   (unpointed → baseDays only)
//   ratio        = ageDays / expectedDays  →  ok (<100%) · watch (≥100%) · overdue (≥150%)
//
// `today` is injected (never reads the clock) so the math is deterministic and unit-testable
// (ADR-052: calendar days, not business days — deliberately simple until noise warrants
// otherwise). v1.60 (ADR-072): the calendar-day helpers below relocated here from the now-deleted
// nudge-card helper module (that Huddle sidebar card was retired; this was their only remaining
// consumer) — same convention, no behavior change.
//
// Age comes from `IssueSummary.inProgressSince` (when the issue entered its CURRENT status,
// resolved from the Jira changelog by get_active_sprint's withAging option). Issues without it
// are EXCLUDED entirely rather than guessed at — an unknown age shows nothing, never a wrong number.
