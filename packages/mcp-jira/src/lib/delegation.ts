/**
 * Shared credentials / delegation (v1.46, ADR-056).
 *
 * A teammate can be onboarded with NO tokens of their own: an admin points their account at a
 * "credential source" user (typically the admin). Their requests then run on the source's
 * Jira/GitHub/AI connections, read the source's local team stores, and inherit the source's
 * board/env overrides — a shared point-of-view onto the same board.
 *
 * Safety: a Jira MUTATION made on a borrowed token is attributed to the token's owner in Jira's
 * history. So a borrower is READ-ONLY against Jira unless an admin explicitly sets `allowWrites`.
 * Delegation is never chained (a source must own its credentials), so there's no resolution cycle.
