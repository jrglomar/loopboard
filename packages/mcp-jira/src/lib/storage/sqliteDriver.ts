/**
 * SQLite storage driver (v1.65, ADR-077) — `STORAGE_DRIVER=sqlite`, the production option.
 * One `better-sqlite3` database file backs every store, in a single `docs` table keyed by
 * (scope, name). better-sqlite3 is SYNCHRONOUS, matching the port's contract exactly — no
 * async ripple into the store/tool/route call graph.
 *
 * The connection is a lazy singleton: `new Database(filePath)` doesn't happen until the first
 * `readDoc`/`writeDoc` call, and every call after that reuses the same handle. WAL mode is
 * enabled on open (better-sqlite3 silently uses its in-memory journal for `:memory:` instead —
 * harmless, not an error).
 *
 * Auto-import (item 189, ADR-077): the FIRST time the table is found empty (fresh db file, or a
 * fresh `:memory:` instance in tests), an injected `loadImportCandidates()` is asked for every
 * doc that exists in the JSON stores today; all of them are inserted in one transaction and the
 * import is logged loudly. `runAutoImportIfEmpty` is exported separately (not just inlined into
 * `ensureOpen`) so tests can drive the empty-table guard directly against a live `Database`
 * handle without needing a real process restart to prove "a second open imports nothing."

// better-sqlite3 is an OPTIONAL, native dependency (v1.65, ADR-077 revised): it ships prebuilt
// binaries but has no musl build and can fall back to compiling from source, which fails in build
// environments without a prebuilt-binary download or a C/Python toolchain. To keep the WHOLE app
// buildable and runnable on the default json driver even when better-sqlite3 can't install, its
// value is loaded LAZILY (only when STORAGE_DRIVER=sqlite actually builds this driver) — a static
// top-level import here would pull it into every store's module graph and crash on absence. The
// TYPE import below is erased at runtime, so it never triggers a require.
