/**
 * The 10 store names that have a SHARED-scope presence (i.e. can resolve outside a per-user
 * request context) plus their `*_FILE` env override, if any (v1.65, ADR-077). This is the one
 * place that maps a storage "name" to config.ts's per-store override field — used by the
 * production json driver (index.ts) to stay byte-identical to the pre-port `getXFilePath()`
 * functions, and by autoImport.ts to find each store's current file when scanning for docs to
 * import into sqlite.
 *
 * `journal` is deliberately absent — a journal is ALWAYS per-user (keyed by the real user id,
 * never SHARED_SCOPE) and has no override env var; the json driver's generic per-user path
 * formula already covers it with no registry entry needed.
